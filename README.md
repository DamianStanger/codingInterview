# Coding Interview Frameworks #

Sample C# solutions to form a basis of code interviews

## Shapes Interview (Basic C#) ##
This solution is designed to test very basic knowledge of C#, it does use unit tests using nunit but the candidate need not really know about unit testing or nunit to do this.

I implemented the tests in the branch [Damo](https://github.com/DamianStanger/codingInterview/tree/Damo)

## Fizz Buzz (Basic C#) ##
There is an integration test that forms the basis of the testing which can test the end to end solution. Its up to the interviewer on how the interview progresess, should the candidate drive the code through pure TDD or just go and see what happens? either way there is an over arching test that can be used to guide the candidate to a correct solution.

Rules of Fizz Buzz are here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizz_buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizz_buzz)

I implemented FizzBuzz here [DamoFizzBuzz](https://github.com/DamianStanger/codingInterview/tree/DamoFizzBuzz) Warning, i used a totally test driven overkill method to this, not the YAGNI agile solution that would make most sense (maybe i'll do that version later).
